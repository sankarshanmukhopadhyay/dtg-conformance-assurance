# DCAS v0.1 — Positioning Note  
**Decentralized Conformance and Assurance Standard**

## Why DCAS exists

Decentralized Trust Graph (DTG) ecosystems increasingly depend on **ecosystem-mediated trust**
rather than direct bilateral verification. As these ecosystems scale, participants rely on
assertions about how other actors operate: who may issue which claims, under what authority,
with what oversight, and with what redress.

Today, many of these assurances are **implicit**. They are expressed through documentation,
reputation, or informal governance rather than through explicit, reviewable, and verifiable
structures. This creates **epistemic uncertainty**: participants cannot reliably distinguish
strong governance from weak governance, or intentional assurance from accidental compliance.

DCAS exists to address this gap.

## What DCAS does

DCAS defines a **risk-based conformance and assurance model** for DTG ecosystems. It provides a
shared structure for expressing:

- Risks relevant to DTG ecosystems and actor roles
- Control objectives that mitigate those risks
- Conformance profiles that group obligations by actor class
- Assurance levels that scale evaluation rigor with risk
- Evidence and tests that substantiate conformance claims
- Machine-readable representations to enable automation and auditability

DCAS is not a checklist. It is a way to make governance **explicit, comparable, and reviewable**
without mandating a single technical or institutional model.

---

## What DCAS is not

DCAS v0.1 explicitly does **not**:

- Define legal or regulatory compliance
- Mandate specific technologies or protocols
- Prescribe business models or governance structures
- Define certification or accreditation schemes
- Replace local or community governance

Instead, DCAS provides a **common semantic and structural substrate** that ecosystems may adopt,
extend, or reference.

## Core design principles

DCAS is built on a small number of guiding principles:

- **Risk-first, not checklist-first**  
  Conformance requirements derive from identified risks, not from generic control lists.

- **Role-aware governance**  
  Different actors carry different authority and risk exposure; obligations must reflect this.

- **Outcome-focused controls**  
  Control objectives define intent and constraints, not implementation details.

- **Proportional assurance**  
  Assurance rigor scales with impact, likelihood, and systemic risk.

- **Separation of concerns**  
  DCAS separates governance intent (controls), substantiation (evidence/tests), and confidence
  (assurance levels).

- **Machine-readable by design**  
  Conformance claims should be expressible and verifiable by both humans and systems.

## What DCAS v0.1 delivers

DCAS v0.1 establishes:

- A stable **conceptual model** for risk-based conformance
- A **normative vocabulary** for controls, profiles, and assurance
- Clear relationships between spreadsheets, annexes, and schemas
- A governance framework for evolution and change

It is intentionally scoped to support **working-group review and refinement**, not to finalize
certification programs or enforcement regimes.

---

## How DCAS should be read

DCAS v0.1 is designed so that:

- Reviewers can agree or disagree with **specific sections and statements**
- Disagreements are framed in terms of risk, scope, and assurance
- Future extensions can occur without weakening core semantics

Annexes carry detailed mappings, schemas, and examples. The core document defines structure
and meaning.

---

## Intended next steps

DCAS v0.1 is a foundation. Subsequent work may include:

- Refinement of control objective catalogs
- Maturation of conformance profiles
- Deeper assurance guidance
- Alignment with regulatory or certification frameworks
- Expanded machine-readable tooling

None of these are pre-decided by v0.1.

## In one sentence

**DCAS makes trust claims in DTG ecosystems explicit, reviewable, and proportionate to risk—without dictating how ecosystems must be built.**
